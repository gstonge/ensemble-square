# ensemble-square
Repository for the ensemble-square project

## Installation

First, clone the repository. This can be done in the terminal using the following command
```
git clone git@github.com:gstonge/ensemble-square.git
```

Second, check the requirements in `requirements.txt`. If some are missing, install them. You can
install all requirements in the terminal using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in the `ensemble-square` directory.

Also, make sure the [scorepi](https://github.com/gstonge/scorepi) package is installed (not in the requirement list), as well as [jupyter lab or jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) (whichever is prefered).

You should now be able to use the notebooks.
